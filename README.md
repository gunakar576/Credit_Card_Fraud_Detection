# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a classic and critical application of machine learning and data analytics used in the banking and financial industry to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. Hereâ€™s an overview, suitable for a project, report, or presentation.
## Overview
Credit card fraud occurs when someone uses your card or card details to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals. Since fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones, detecting them poses unique challenges.
## Goals of Fraud Detection
- Identify fraudulent transactions as early as possible.

- Minimize false positives (flagging legitimate transactions as fraud).

- Minimize false negatives (missing actual fraud).

 - Improve real-time detection.

## Steps in Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
 **1. Data Collection**
- Transaction history (amount, time)

- Customer data

- Labels: Fraudulent or not

**2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handling class imbalance (fraud cases are rare)

- Feature engineering 

- Normalization/Scaling

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze patterns in fraud vs. legit

- Visualizations (e.g., bar plot,count plot)
- 
**4. Model Building**
- Common models include:

- Logistic Regression

**5. Evaluation Metrics**
- accuracy_score
